# NOTICE

HotSwitch is **DEPRECCATED** now.

HotSwitch does't work on macOS Monterey and has some bugs on previous macOS.
If you want to use HotSwitch on macOS monterey, use [HotSwitch-HS](https://github.com/oniatsu/HotSwitch-HS) as a substitution.

HotSwitch-HS uses [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/), and is rewritten for a substitution of HotSwitch.


# Smart and quick

HotSwitch is a window switcher app using **2 stroke hotkey** for mac OS.

It provides fastest window switching, **no matter how many windows** there are.
