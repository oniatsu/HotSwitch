# NOTICE

HotSwitch is **DEPRECATED**.

HotSwitch does't work on macOS Monterey or later and has some bugs on previous macOS.
If you want to use HotSwitch, use **[HotSwitch-HS](https://github.com/oniatsu/HotSwitch-HS)**.

**HotSwitch-HS** uses [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/), and is rewritten for a substitution of HotSwitch.

# Smart and quick
